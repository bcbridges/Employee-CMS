# Employee-CMS

## Description

This Employee Content Management System (CMS) was designed to help track departments, roles within those departments, and subset employees. It is a command line application that prompts the user to input the necessary employee, department, and role information, or allows the user to see several reports that summarize the data currently within the system. The CMS was created utilizing SQL databases to store, retrieve, and update the data within this program.
